        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        <p class="home-font">I am from one of the most beautiful and peaceful places on Earth, The Big Island of <span class="hawaii">Hawaii</span>. I moved to the mainland United States in search of a career, and chose Portland, Oregon to be my new home. I am currently in an amazing coding bootcamp, <em>Epicodus</em>, where I intended to expand my knowledge and start a career. Growing up in such a rural and isolated community has had it's interesting aspects, but has also shaped me to be who I am today.</p>

            <h3>Wikipedia Homepage Project</h3>
            <img src="img/wiki.jpg" class="img-fix">
            <p>The idea of this project was to try to copy the current homepage of Wikipedia homepage as well as possible. Although myself and my partner spent a fair amount of time on the project, I think that it turned out fairly well. This is the newest project that I had worked on up until this date. This project used HTML and CSS.<a href="https://julianflood1.github.io/wiki">Check it out here!</a></p>

            <h3>Vacation Rental Project</h3>
            <img src="img/vacation.jpg" class="img-fix">
            <p>The purpose of this project was to try and "sell" one of these vacation rentals to a potential "buyer". This was an exercise that we did through Epicodus to practice different branches in GitHub. It was a fun project, and was one of the few projects we did that utilized different branches.This project used HTML and CSS.<a href="https://julianflood1.github.io/vacation-site/">Check it out here!</a></p>

            <img src="img/shelter.jpg" class="img-fix">
            <p>This Animal Shelter Project utilized a lot of the features that I know up to this point from Epicodus. It was a project that introduced columns, along with some other features as well. This was a fun project, and I actually got a good laugh out of making it with my partner.This project used HTML and CSS.<a href="https://julianflood1.github.io/animal-shelter/">Check it out here!</a></p>

        <img src="img/future.jpg">
        <p>In the future, I hope to complete the design track at Epicodus, and move on to a career in the technology industry; ideally in User Experience Design or User Interface Design. I am confident in my ability to use the tools I will learn through Epicodus, and apply them to a long and fruitful career in the industry.</p>
