  <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
  <p class="home-font">I am from one of the most beautiful and peaceful places on Earth, The Big Island of Hawaii. I moved to the mainland United States in search of a career, and have found the necessary program to do so, through this amazing coding bootcamp, <em>Epicodus</em>. Growing up in such a rural and isolated community has had it's interesting aspects, but has also shaped me to be who I am today.</p>
