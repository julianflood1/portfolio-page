      <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
      <p class="home-font">I am from one of the most beautiful and peaceful places on Earth, The Big Island of Hawaii. I moved to the mainland United States in search of a career, and have found the necessary program to do so, through this amazing coding bootcamp, <em>Epicodus</em>. Growing up in such a rural and isolated community has had it's interesting aspects, but has also shaped me to be who I am today.</p>

      <h3>Wikipedia Homepage Project</h3>
      <img src="img/wiki.jpg" class="img-fix">
      <p>This idea of this project was to try to copy the current homepage of Wikipedia homepage as well as possible. Although myself and partner spent a fair amount of time on the project, I think that it turned out fairly well. This is the newest project that I had worked on up until this date.</p>

      <h3>Vacation Rental Project</h3>
      <img src="img/vacation.jpg" class="img-fix">
      <p>The purpose of this project was to try and "sell" one of these vacation rentals to a potential "buyer". This was an exercise that we did through Epicodus to practice different branches in GitHub. It was a fun project, and was one of the few projects we did that utilized different branches.</p>

      <h3>Animal Shelter Project</h3>
      <img src="img/shelter.jpg" class="img-fix">
      <p>This Animal Shelter Project utilized a lot of the features that I know up to this point from Epicodus. It was a project that introduced columns, along with some other features as well. This was a fun project, and I actually got a good laugh out of making it with my partner.</p>
